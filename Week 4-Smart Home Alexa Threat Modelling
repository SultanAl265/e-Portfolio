# **Topic: Smart Home Alexa Threat Modeling**

This repository explores threat modeling in a smart home IoT environment using Alexa. The goal is to identify, assess, and mitigate potential security risks associated with device interactions and user actions.

---

## **Scenario**

The smart home setup includes an Alexa device connected to a smartphone. The functionalities considered in this threat model include:

* Controlling lights
* Operating garage doors
* Receiving alerts for motion detection or door activity
* Managing music playlists and grocery lists

This scenario helps evaluate the risks involved in common smart home activities and the security measures needed.

## **Threat Modeling Techniques**

**STRIDE**
STRIDE, developed by Microsoft, categorizes threats into Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege (Shevchenko et al., 2018). It is used here to identify potential vulnerabilities in Alexa's interactions with connected devices.

**DREAD**
DREAD evaluates threats based on Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability (Meier et al., 2003). It is used to prioritize risks identified through STRIDE.

## **STRIDE Analysis**

**Spoofing**: Unauthorized users may impersonate the legitimate user to gain control over Alexa and connected devices (Shevchenko et al., 2018).

**Tampering**: Attackers could manipulate commands or responses between Alexa and devices, altering light settings or garage door status (Meier et al., 2003).

**Repudiation**: Users may deny actions performed through Alexa, such as turning off lights or opening the garage, causing accountability issues (Ross et al., 2016).

**Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data like grocery lists, voice commands, or home activity could be exposed to unauthorized parties (Shevchenko et al., 2018).

**Denial of Service**: Attackers may overload the system or network, preventing Alexa from executing commands (GitHub, 2021).

**Elevation of Privilege**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Alexa or connected devices to gain administrative control (Salter et al., 1998).

| Threat                 | Damage | Reproducibility | Exploitability | Affected Users | Discoverability | Risk Score |
| ---------------------- | ------ | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Spoofing               | 4      | 3               | 3              | 5              | 4               | 19         |
| Tampering              | 5      | 2               | 4              | 5              | 3               | 19         |
| Information Disclosure | 4      | 3               | 3              | 5              | 4               | 19         |

| Elevation of Privilege | 5      | 2               | 4              | 5              | 3               | 19         |

## **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

* Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent spoofing.
* Use encrypted communication between Alexa and smart devices.
* Enable logging and accountability features to track user actions.
* Limit data exposure and follow privacy best practices for sensitive information.
* Implement rate limiting and monitoring to reduce denial-of-service risks.
* Regularly update firmware and software to prevent privilege escalation.
