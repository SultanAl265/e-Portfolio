**Initial Post:** Risk Assessment of Digitalising Traditional Business Processes

The term ‘Industry 4.0’, as defined by Hancock et al. (2024), refers to the fourth industrial revolution—characterised by the integration of emerging digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and big data analytics into traditional manufacturing and business operations. These technologies aim to transform industries by enabling real-time data exchange, automation, and enhanced decision-making. For example, predictive maintenance using IoT sensors in smart factories allows early detection of equipment failures, minimising downtime and improving operational efficiency (Pech et al., 2021). Another example is the use of blockchain technology in logistics, which enhances supply chain transparency by ensuring secure and traceable transaction records (Xu et al., 2021).

However, applying digitalisation to traditional business models introduces significant risks. Hancock et al. (2024) classify these into three key categories: technological, organisational, and environmental risks. A real-world technological risk includes the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which exploited outdated systems across global organisations, notably impacting the UK's National Health Service (NHS) (Minnaar and Herbig, 2021). This illustrates the cyber vulnerabilities linked to legacy systems being insufficiently protected in digital environments (Hancock et al., 2024).

A notable organisational risk involves the skills gap and resistance to change. For instance, when retailers adopt AI-driven customer service tools without providing adequate training, employees may feel threatened or unprepared, which can result in poor adoption and negative customer experiences (Farbod, S., 2024). This highlights the importance of aligning digital transformation efforts with organisational culture and workforce capabilities.

The arguments made in Hancock et al. (2024) are supported by Liao et al. (2017), who emphasise that while Industry 4.0 offers increased productivity, it simultaneously introduces challenges such as cybersecurity threats, increased system complexity, and resistance from human actors. Both studies advocate for structured risk assessment frameworks as a crucial part of the digital transformation journey to identify, evaluate, and mitigate emerging risks effectively.

**Peer Response**
The authors present a detailed examination of Industry 4.0 risks, demonstrating how technological vulnerabilities and organisational challenges manifest in real-world scenarios, including the WannaCry ransomware incident and the implementation of AI in retail operations. Your explanation demonstrates a strong understanding of how digitalisation impacts traditional business processes (Hancock et al., 2024; Pech et al., 2021).
Your post effectively illustrates the technological vulnerabilities posed by legacy systems and highlights the human factor in organisational risk. It is also important to consider regulatory and compliance risks, which are often inherent in digital transformation initiatives. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict requirements on data handling, and non-compliance can result in substantial penalties (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017). Preventive measures could include implementing robust cybersecurity protocols aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 standards, conducting regular employee training programs, and establishing clear digital governance frameworks to ensure both technological and human factors are managed proactively (Klaus et al., 2022).
To add value, the author may consider exploring the case study by Müller et al. (2022) on digital twin implementation in manufacturing. This study demonstrates how organisations can simulate and assess risks in a virtual environment before deploying Industry 4.0 technologies, providing a practical approach to mitigating operational and technological risks. Integrating such frameworks could enhance your discussion of preventive strategies and risk management in digitalised business processes.

**Summary Post**
In my initial post, I analysed the risks of digitalising traditional business processes in the context of Industry 4.0. I explained how technologies such as IoT, AI, blockchain, and big data analytics enable automation, predictive maintenance, and secure supply chains (Pech et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021). However, I also highlighted risks such as technological vulnerabilities, using the WannaCry ransomware attack as an example of how outdated systems expose organisations to cyber threats (Minnaar & Herbig, 2021), and organisational risks like workforce resistance to AI-driven change (Farbod, 2024).
Peer feedback strengthened this analysis by adding regulatory and compliance risks. For instance, frameworks such as GDPR require robust data protection, and non-compliance can lead to serious penalties (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017). Suggested measures included ISO/IEC 27001 cybersecurity protocols, governance frameworks, and employee training (Klaus et al., 2022). Another valuable contribution was the use of digital twins, which allow businesses to model risks in a virtual environment before deploying new systems (Müller et al., 2022).
My learning across the first three units reinforces these points. Unit 1 introduced the foundations of security and risk management, which helped me understand why risks in Industry 4.0 must be categorised and assessed systematically (Liao et al., 2017). Unit 2 focused on users, assessments, and the risk management process, which aligns with my discussion of organisational culture and skills gaps—showing the importance of user readiness in reducing risks. Unit 3 covered threat modelling and management, providing tools to anticipate vulnerabilities such as ransomware, compliance failures, and insider threats. These frameworks give structure to the preventive strategies highlighted in both my post and my peer’s response.
Industry 4.0 offers transformative opportunities, but sustainable adoption depends on robust cybersecurity, compliance, workforce training, and structured risk management.
