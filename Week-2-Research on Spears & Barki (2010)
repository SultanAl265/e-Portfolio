# **Topic: AI in Risk Management**

As part of this activity, I reviewed the study by Spears and Barki (2010) to explore how organizations assess and manage information systems security risks. The authors employed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative data (through interviews and surveys) with quantitative analysis (using statistical models) to evaluate how user participation influences the success of risk management practices. This dual-method strategy provided both rich, contextual insights and empirical validation, enhancing the reliability and applicability of their findings.

Building on this research, I investigated how AI-powered data analytics can further enhance risk management. AI enables the real-time identification of anomalies, supports predictive modelling, and strengthens decision-making for business continuity in volatile environments (Zhang et al., 2021). Moreover, I found that integrating multiple AI technologies—such as machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), and computer vision—beyond just natural language processing (NLP), creates a more adaptive and comprehensive risk strategy. This multi-technology integration is particularly valuable in automating threat detection, fraud monitoring, and operational risk management (Davenport and Ronanki, 2018).

This research helped me better understand the evolving role of AI in corporate risk governance and the need for holistic, data-driven approaches in managing modern enterprise risks.
