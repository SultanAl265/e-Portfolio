# GDPR Case Study: Department of Health – Autism Dossiers

The Department of Health Autism Dossiers case highlights serious GDPR compliance issues, particularly concerning data minimisation and lawful processing. The department collected excessive personal data on children with autism without their families’ knowledge, violating GDPR requirements that personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and only for necessary purposes (Data Protection Commission, 2020). This breach demonstrates a failure to limit data collection to what is necessary and to properly inform data subjects about the processing of their information (Aven & Thekdi, 2025). Following an investigation, the Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined the department €22,500 and prohibited the continuation of such practices (Data Protection Commission, 2020).

If I were the Information Security Manager, I would take several steps to prevent a similar issue. I would conduct a full data audit to ensure all collected personal data aligns with GDPR principles (Sutton, 2021). Data minimisation practices would be strictly enforced, and clear data retention policies would ensure information is not kept longer than necessary (Adhillah et al., 2025). Staff training would be provided regularly to improve awareness of GDPR compliance and the risks of mishandling data (Aven & Thekdi, 2025). Additionally, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) would be carried out before any new data collection activities to identify potential risks to data subjects. Adopting IT security frameworks such as ISO 27001 or NIST would support technical safeguards like encryption, access controls, and audit trails to protect sensitive information (Kirvan, 2021). These steps would strengthen governance, reduce risk, and ensure compliance with GDPR.

During team discussions, we compared different GDPR case studies and observed common risks such as excessive data collection and lack of transparency. This helped me understand how risk management frameworks and IT security standards can be applied in practice to support GDPR compliance. Overall, this case study emphasizes the importance of careful data handling and proactive risk management to prevent legal and reputational consequences.
