# Unit 7–9 Discussion Activity  
**Topic:** Critique of CVSS and Alternatives  

---

## Initial Post  

Spring et al. (2021) point out several problems with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). They argue that CVSS tries to give a single number for vulnerability risk, but this number often ignores important context. For example, a vulnerability may be rated “critical” in CVSS even if strong security controls are already in place to reduce the risk. The authors also note that the scoring process is not always consistent because it depends on the judgment of the person doing the assessment. This makes the results look precise when in fact they can be misleading (Allodi & Massacci, 2014). I agree with this criticism because depending only on the CVSS score may cause organisations to fix the wrong issues first, while real risks remain unaddressed.  

One alternative that Spring et al. (2021) discuss is the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC). Unlike CVSS, SSVC considers the specific situation of the organisation and helps guide action. Instead of just producing a number, SSVC recommends clear outcomes such as “act,” “track,” or “defer.” This makes it more practical for decision-making because it links vulnerability management to the needs and resources of the organisation. For this reason, SSVC is a better choice to replace CVSS.

## Reflection  

This activity helped me understand the limitations of relying only on CVSS scores for vulnerability management. I realised that while CVSS gives a simple way to rank vulnerabilities, it can sometimes be misleading because it ignores organisational context. Writing this discussion also improved my ability to use academic references to support my arguments. I found SSVC more practical than CVSS because it provides specific actions instead of just a score, which is more useful for real-world decision-making. Overall, I learned the importance of looking beyond numbers and focusing on context when evaluating security risks.
