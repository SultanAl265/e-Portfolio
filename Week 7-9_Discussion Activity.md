# Unit 7–9 Discussion Activity  
**Topic:** Critique of CVSS and Alternatives  

---

## Initial Post  

Spring et al. (2021) point out several problems with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). They argue that CVSS tries to give a single number for vulnerability risk, but this number often ignores important context. For example, a vulnerability may be rated “critical” in CVSS even if strong security controls are already in place to reduce the risk. The authors also note that the scoring process is not always consistent because it depends on the judgment of the person doing the assessment. This makes the results look precise when in fact they can be misleading (Allodi & Massacci, 2014). I agree with this criticism because depending only on the CVSS score may cause organisations to fix the wrong issues first, while real risks remain unaddressed.  

One alternative that Spring et al. (2021) discuss is the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC). Unlike CVSS, SSVC considers the specific situation of the organisation and helps guide action. Instead of just producing a number, SSVC recommends clear outcomes such as “act,” “track,” or “defer.” This makes it more practical for decision-making because it links vulnerability management to the needs and resources of the organisation. For this reason, SSVC is a better choice to replace CVSS.

## Reflection from Initial and Peer post

Engaging with this discussion activity has significantly deepened my understanding of vulnerability assessment frameworks and their role in effective security decision-making. Initially, my focus was on the limitations of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), particularly its reliance on a single numerical score that often overlooks the organisational context and can lead to misaligned remediation priorities (Spring et al., 2021; Allodi and Massacci, 2014). However, after considering my peers’ feedback and conducting further research, I now appreciate that CVSS, despite its flaws, remains a valuable component of a broader, multi-layered vulnerability management strategy.

Peer insights helped me recognise the benefits of integrating multiple frameworks for a more comprehensive approach. For instance, combining CVSS with the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) — which provides predictive data on exploitability — and the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) — which offers context-aware, actionable outcomes such as “act,” “track,” or “defer” — allows organisations to make more informed prioritisation decisions (Ghanem et al., 2025). This hybrid model aligns vulnerability management with real-world operational needs, threat intelligence, and resource constraints.

This activity has also improved my ability to critically evaluate academic literature and synthesise different perspectives. It highlighted the importance of going beyond static severity scores and considering factors such as exploit likelihood, business impact, and compensating controls when assessing vulnerabilities. Ultimately, I learned that adopting a layered approach that integrates CVSS, EPSS, and SSVC can lead to more strategic, risk-informed security decisions and better allocation of resources (Spring et al., 2021; Ghanem et al., 2025).
